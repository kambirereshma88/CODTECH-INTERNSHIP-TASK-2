# CODTECH-INTERNSHIP-TASK-2
Name: Reshma Rahul Suryawanshi Company: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS ID:CT08DS87 Domain:Data Analytics Duration: Nov to Dec 2024


Objective

The purpose of this project is to develop a predictive model using Linear Regression to identify and forecast trends based on historical data. The project demonstrates how regression analysis can be applied to solve real-world problems, such as predicting sales, prices, or other continuous variables.

Features

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handled missing values and prepared the dataset for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized key trends and relationships between variables to better understand the dataset.

Model Implementation: Built and trained a Linear Regression model to predict the target variable.

Performance Metrics: Evaluated the model using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

Methodology

Dataset Preparation:

Loaded and cleaned the dataset.

Conducted feature selection and engineering to optimize model input.

Exploratory Data Analysis:

Used visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, heatmaps) to identify patterns and correlations.

Examined the distribution of the target variable and key predictors.

Model Building:

Implemented a Linear Regression model using Python's sklearn library.

Split the dataset into training and testing subsets to evaluate performance.

Evaluation:

Measured the model's performance on test data using statistical metrics.

Identified potential improvements based on residual analysis.

Results

Accuracy: The model achieved a high R-squared value, indicating a strong correlation between predicted and actual values.

Error Metrics: MAE and MSE were within acceptable ranges, validating the model's effectiveness in predictions.

Insights: The analysis highlighted key features contributing significantly to the target variable, providing actionable insights for stakeholders.

Tools and Libraries

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
